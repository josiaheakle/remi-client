Plan of action -

   BUG - verify email does not update when email gets verified

   Make app mobile responsive
   Update Remi text
   Add Token function to headers to add more security
   Only allow 3 reminders for free version or something || or add ads 

 7. Update Remi text
    a. If email or phone is not verified
    b. If reminder is coming up
    c. Add array of things to say randomly when logged in
 8. Fix CSS so code is universal
 9. Make App mobile responsive
10. Clean up whatever is left and host it!


11. Add way to make money off of it or at least cover the cost of the reminders
12. Add token function so user stays logged in and is secure
